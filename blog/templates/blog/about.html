            <h2 class="text-center"> about me </h2><br>
            <p> I'm a seeker, a finder, an explorer who is always looking for something that even me myself couldn't make out!
                What I always know is that I never stop. I never stop evolving because that's how the world, humanity, technology and everything else work.
                Beside being an awesome explorer, I'm also a creator, not the creator, but I love to create, to make things.
                I want to live a life that when I grow older, I have something to pass to younger generations, to my pupils *lol*.<br><br>

            <p class="text-left">I called this site "T", initial for my first name because I think this blog is also a place I can express 100% of myself.
                T consists of 2 intended categories which are "technology" and "lifestyle".</p>
